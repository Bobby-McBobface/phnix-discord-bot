# phnix-discord-bot

A Discord bot used in 1 (big) Discord server due to the mods not liking MEE6 anymore. And now there's other maintained bots to easily import MEE6's data, but the data isn't in MEE6 anymore, so we are trapped in our own ecosystem.

Reasons for rewrite
- The old bot will break in 2023
- I can't stand my old legacy code
